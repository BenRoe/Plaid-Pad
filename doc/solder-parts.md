# Build guide

### Diodes 1N4148 (D1-D16)
Diodes are __polarized__. The black line on the diode (cathode) must face to the squared solder pad.
The 1N4148 diodes look similar as Zener diodes. Make sure to not confuse both diodes.


### Zener diodes (D49, D50)
Diodes are __polarized__. The black line on the diode (cathode) must face to the squared solder pad.
The 1N4148 diodes look similar as Zener diodes. Make sure to not confuse both diodes.

### Resettable fuse(F1)
After soldering bend the fuse like in the image.

### Electrolytic capacitor(C3)
The Electrolytic capacitor is __polarized__. The short leg is cathode. (square pad on pcb)

### Resistors 1.5k Ohm (R1, R7, R8)
- brown, green, black, brown, brown

### Resistors 75 Ohm (R2, R3)
- purple, green, black, gold, brown

### Resistors 10k Ohm (R4)
- brown, black, black, red, brown

### Resistors 5.1k Ohm (R9, R10)
- green, brown, black, brown, brown

### USB-C connector (J1)
Double check that are no short between the pad's.
Best to use a magnifier.

### Led's (LED1, LED2)
Led1 indicates that the Plaid-Pad is powered and constantly on.
I prefer to solder the red led on LED1, because the led is less bright.

### Crystal (Y1)


### Capacitors 22pF (C1, C2)
They have a small pitch (2.5mm).

### Capacitors 0.1uF (C4, C5)
Bigger pitch with 5mm

### IC socket U1
The IC socket is __polarized__. Check the notch on silk and IC Socket.

### Tactile switch (SW50/RESET, SW51/BOOT)


### ATMEGA328p chip
The ATMEGA328 is a __polarized__. Check the notch on the chip and IC Socket.

## Check list before connecting USB
- No short on the USB-C connector pad's
- Direction of polarized components (ATMEGA328p, diode, resettable fuse, electrolytic capacitor)
- Resistor value
